        I have no idea how to start solving this mission.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        The general idea is to move over the first string and for each character
        get and remember character from the second string on the same position.
        If in some moment there are more then one character from the second string
        correspond to one character from the first, then the first string is not
        isometric to the second.

        Read about build-in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3resource.com/python/built-in-function/enumerate.php">enumerate()</a> function.
        It gives you both character and its index in string. Use for loop to
        iterate over this enumerate object:
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
for ind, char in enumerate(a):
    # do something
        </pre>

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        I don't understand how to store corresponding between characters in strings.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You need <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp">dictionary</a>
        to store characters from the first string as keys and corresponding characters
        from the second string as values. Create empty dictionary before iterating:
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
dic = {}
for ind, char in enumerate(a):
    dic[char] = ...         
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        Ok, how exactly to fill in this dictionary?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        I recommend you to use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp">sets/a>
        as values of dictionary to store only unique characters. Use dictionary
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_access.asp">get()</a> method
        with default value equal empty set. Also use Set <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_set_union.asp">union()</a>
        method to add character from the second string with specific index to the
        dictionary value set:
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
dic = {}
for ind, char in enumerate(a):
    dic[char] = dic.get(char, set()).union(set(b[ind]))
        </pre>
        So, for each unique character in the first string you add all the characters
        from the second string on the corresponding position.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        So, how to check if the first string is isometric to the second?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Function should return True when to each unique character from the first string there is only
        one corresponding character from the second string. So, after updating
        the value set in dictionary make a check: if its length become more then
        one, then it is not 1-to-1 corresponding:
    <br />
    <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
if len(dic[char]) > 1:
    return False
        </pre>
        On finishing iterating over the first string, if there were no False return,
        return True since the first string is isometric to the second.

    <div class="question">
        So, how my final solution should look like?

        Wrap the whole code into function expression. Here it is:

        Use zip() function to create tuples of characters from two strings with
        the same index, keep unique ones with set(). The length if this set
        should be equal to the set of the first string.
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
def isometric_strings(str1: str, str2: str) -> bool:

    return len(set(zip(str1, str2))) == len(set(str1))
        </pre>
        String method str.maketrans() creates dictionary, where keys are characters from the first
        string and values - from the second. Then, using this ductionary, translate
        the first string. If the result is equal to the second string, return True.
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
def isometric_strings(str1: str, str2: str) -> bool:

    trans = str.maketrans(str1, str2)
    
    return str1.translate(trans) == str2
